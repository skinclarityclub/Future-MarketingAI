## üö® Critical Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. **Memory Usage Crisis**

- **Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Finding**: Memory usage consistently above 90% across all test scenarios
- **Impact**: Risk of system instability, potential OOM crashes, degraded performance
- **Root Cause**: Likely memory leaks, inefficient data structures, or lack of garbage collection

### 2. **Low Throughput Performance**

- **Status**: üü° WARNING
- **Finding**: Basic load test achieved only 7.8 req/s with 10 users
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during peak usage
- **Root Cause**: Inefficient API response handling, database query optimization needed

### 3. **Response Time Degradation Under Load**

- **Status**: üü° WARNING
- **Finding**: Response times increase from 616ms to 1,724ms as load increases
- **Impact**: User experience deteriorates significantly under high load
- **Root Cause**: Lack of caching, database bottlenecks, synchronous processing
