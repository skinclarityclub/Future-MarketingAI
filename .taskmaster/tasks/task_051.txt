# Task ID: 51
# Title: Fix Critical API Endpoints for CMS System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Repair AI Content Generation API (404), A/B Testing Performance API (import errors), and resolve dependency issues. Ensure all Task 34 components are fully functional.
# Details:
1. **AI Content Generation API**: Investigate and resolve the 404 error by checking the API endpoint configuration, server routes, and deployment settings. Ensure the endpoint is correctly registered and accessible from the CMS system. Update any outdated documentation or configurations that might be causing the issue.

2. **A/B Testing Performance API**: Address import errors by reviewing the API's data import logic and dependencies. Check for any missing libraries or incorrect import paths. Ensure all necessary modules are correctly installed and configured. Test the API with sample data to verify successful imports.

3. **Dependency Issues**: Analyze the dependency graph for the CMS system to identify and resolve any conflicts or missing dependencies. Update package managers and ensure all dependencies are compatible with the current system version.

4. **Task 34 Components**: Review the components developed in Task 34, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the fixed APIs. Conduct thorough testing to confirm full functionality and performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. **AI Content Generation API**: Use Postman or a similar tool to send requests to the API endpoint and verify that it returns the expected responses without errors.

2. **A/B Testing Performance API**: Run test cases to simulate data imports and verify that the API processes the data correctly without import errors.

3. **Dependency Verification**: Use a dependency management tool to check for and resolve any conflicts or missing packages. Run the CMS system to ensure all components load and function correctly.

4. **Task 34 Component Testing**: Perform integration tests on the components from Task 34 to ensure they work as expected with the fixed APIs. Validate their functionality through end-to-end testing scenarios.
