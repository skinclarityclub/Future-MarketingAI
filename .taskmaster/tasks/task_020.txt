# Task ID: 20
# Title: Telegram Bot Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the AI chatbot with Telegram to allow users to query dashboard data and interact with the AI assistant through Telegram.
# Details:
To integrate the AI chatbot with Telegram, first set up a Telegram bot using the provided bot token. Implement a webhook to receive messages from Telegram and handle them using a message processing module. Ensure that the bot can authenticate users and manage sessions securely. Implement message handling logic to interpret user queries and interact with the existing AI assistant and dashboard systems. Set up data access controls to ensure that users can only access data they are authorized to view. Use the Telegram Bot API to send and receive messages, and ensure the bot can handle various message types and commands. Consider implementing a command parser to handle specific commands for querying dashboard data. Additionally, ensure that the integration is robust and can handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to users.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the Telegram bot is successfully created and can receive messages via the webhook.
2. Test user authentication and session management to ensure secure access.
3. Send various types of messages and commands to the bot and verify correct handling and responses.
4. Test data access controls by attempting to access unauthorized data and ensuring access is denied.
5. Verify that the bot can interact with the AI assistant and dashboard systems to provide accurate responses to user queries.
6. Conduct load testing to ensure the bot can handle multiple concurrent users without performance degradation.

# Subtasks:
