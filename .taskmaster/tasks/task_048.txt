# Task ID: 48
# Title: Improve Text Contrast and Readability on Dashboard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 23, 30, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance text contrast and readability across all dashboard components by adjusting text colors to ensure high visibility against dark backgrounds.
# Details:
To improve text contrast and readability across the dashboard, identify all instances where text appears in black or dark gray on dark backgrounds. Update these text elements to use white or light-colored text to ensure proper contrast. This includes headers, values, labels, and descriptions throughout the dashboard interface. Use CSS variables or a theme configuration to manage text colors consistently across components. Ensure that changes are responsive and maintain accessibility standards, such as WCAG 2.1 guidelines for contrast ratios.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct a visual audit of the dashboard to identify all text elements that require contrast adjustments.
2. Update the CSS or theme configuration to apply the new text colors.
3. Use automated accessibility testing tools to verify that all text elements meet WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio guidelines.
4. Manually test the dashboard on various devices and screen sizes to ensure text readability is consistently improved.
5. Gather feedback from users to confirm the readability enhancements are effective.
