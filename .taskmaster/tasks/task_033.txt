# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement n8n Workflow Integration Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 24, 31, 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an integration engine to connect the dashboard with n8n workflows, including webhook orchestration, state management, and real-time monitoring.
# Details:
To implement the n8n Workflow Integration Engine, start by setting up webhook orchestration to handle incoming and outgoing data between the dashboard and n8n workflows. Develop a state management system to track the status of workflows and manage their execution states. Implement real-time monitoring features to observe workflow execution, providing logs and error handling capabilities. Ensure automated trigger management to initiate workflows based on specific events or conditions. Enable bidirectional data synchronization to keep the dashboard and n8n in sync. Integrate direct workflow control to allow users to start, stop, and manage workflows from the dashboard. Collect and display performance metrics to analyze workflow efficiency and identify bottlenecks. Consider using existing APIs and libraries to facilitate integration and ensure scalability.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify webhook orchestration by simulating data flow between the dashboard and n8n workflows, ensuring data is correctly received and processed.
2. Test state management by executing workflows and checking the accuracy of status updates and state transitions.
3. Monitor real-time execution to ensure logs are generated and errors are handled appropriately.
4. Validate automated trigger management by setting up conditions and confirming workflows are triggered as expected.
5. Test bidirectional data synchronization by making changes in both the dashboard and n8n, ensuring data consistency.
6. Check direct workflow control by starting and stopping workflows from the dashboard, verifying control accuracy.
7. Analyze performance metrics to ensure they reflect actual workflow performance and identify any inefficiencies.

Webhook Orchestration Setup FULLY COMPLETED AND TESTED! Database tables successfully created via SQL migration, all 5 core tables accessible (webhook_endpoints, webhook_events, workflow_triggers, workflow_executions, data_sync_configs). All API endpoints tested and working: GET (status), POST (incoming webhooks), PUT (register endpoints), PATCH (outgoing webhooks). JSON parsing issues resolved with improved error handling. System is production-ready with 200 status responses.

## 2. Develop State Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Create a system to track and manage the execution states of workflows.
### Details:
Implement a state management module that records workflow status, transitions, and history.
<info added on 2025-06-18T13:33:04.221Z>
Implementation complete. Comprehensive implementation includes: WorkflowStateManager class with full CRUD operations, real-time subscriptions using Supabase channels, state caching for performance, comprehensive state validation and transition rules, history tracking and aggregation. Database schema complete with workflow_states, workflow_state_transitions, and workflow_state_aggregates tables, plus triggers and RLS policies. API endpoints implemented for GET/POST/DELETE operations. Advanced features include real-time notifications, performance metrics, cleanup functions, and comprehensive error handling. All 9 workflow states and 9 transition types implemented with validation. Integration ready for next phase.

## 3. Implement Real-Time Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Develop features to monitor workflow execution in real-time, including logs and error handling.
### Details:
Create a monitoring dashboard that displays workflow execution details, logs, and error reports.
<info added on 2025-06-18T13:45:40.531Z>
Implementation complete for the Real-Time Monitoring System. This comprehensive implementation includes the WorkflowMonitor class with real-time execution tracking, performance metrics collection, error detection and alerting, and live status monitoring. The database schema is fully developed with tables for execution logs, errors, performance metrics, alerts, and statistical aggregation. API endpoints are established for all monitoring operations with full CRUD support. Advanced features include real-time subscriptions via Supabase channels, automated alert processing, performance collection intervals, and dashboard summary generation. UI components are integrated for the monitoring dashboard. A test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all monitoring functionality. The system supports multi-level logging, categorized errors, performance tracking, and automated cleanup, and is ready for bidirectional data synchronization.

BUG FIXES: Fixed Next.js 14 cookies API compatibility issue by awaiting cookies() call in createSupabaseClient function. Fixed database function name from cleanup_monitoring_data to cleanup_old_workflow_states with correct parameter name older_than_days. API now works correctly without terminal errors.
