# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Disaster Recovery Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery framework with multi-region backup strategies, automated failover procedures, and business continuity planning to meet Fortune 500 compliance standards.
# Details:
To implement the Disaster Recovery Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Multi-Region Backup Strategies**: Design and implement a backup system that replicates data across multiple geographic regions. Use cloud services like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage with cross-region replication enabled. Ensure backups are encrypted and stored securely.

2. **Automated Failover Procedures**: Develop automated failover mechanisms to switch operations to a secondary region in case of a primary region failure. Use tools like AWS Route 53 or Azure Traffic Manager for DNS-based failover.

3. **Business Continuity Planning**: Create a business continuity plan that outlines procedures for maintaining operations during a disaster. Include communication plans, resource allocation, and recovery steps.

4. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Ensure that the system can recover within 4 hours (RTO) and data loss is limited to 1 hour (RPO). Implement continuous data replication and frequent backups to meet these objectives.

5. **Regular DR Testing Protocols**: Establish a schedule for regular disaster recovery testing. Conduct full-scale simulations to test the effectiveness of the DR plan and make necessary adjustments based on test results.

6. **Compliance and Documentation**: Ensure all procedures and systems comply with Fortune 500 standards. Document all processes, configurations, and test results for audit purposes.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct a full-scale disaster recovery test by simulating a failure in the primary region and verifying that operations switch to the secondary region within the RTO of 4 hours.
2. Test the backup and restore process to ensure data can be recovered with an RPO of 1 hour.
3. Review the business continuity plan with stakeholders to ensure all roles and responsibilities are clear and actionable.
4. Verify that all DR procedures and systems comply with Fortune 500 standards by conducting an internal audit.
5. Document the results of DR tests and any issues encountered, and update the DR plan accordingly.
