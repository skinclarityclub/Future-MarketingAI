# Task ID: 14
# Title: Develop Tactical Data Analysis Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a data analysis engine that provides predictive insights and automated recommendations based on business data.
# Details:
The Tactical Data Analysis Engine will leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical business data and generate predictive insights. It will integrate with existing data sources such as Shopify, Kajabi, and financial metrics to gather comprehensive data. The engine will use time-series analysis and regression models to forecast future trends and identify potential opportunities or risks. Automated recommendations will be generated based on these insights, helping businesses optimize their strategies. The engine should be designed to handle large datasets efficiently and provide results in real-time. Consider using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and model building. Ensure the engine is scalable and can be easily integrated into the existing dashboard environment.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate data integration by ensuring the engine can successfully pull data from Shopify, Kajabi, and financial metrics.
2. Test the accuracy of predictive insights by comparing the engine's forecasts with actual historical data.
3. Verify the relevance and usefulness of automated recommendations by conducting user testing with business analysts.
4. Ensure the engine can handle large datasets without performance degradation.
5. Test the integration of the engine with the existing dashboard to ensure seamless operation and data flow.
