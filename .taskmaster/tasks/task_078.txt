# Task ID: 78
# Title: Live Data Integration & Mock Data Replacement for MarketingMachine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33, 54, 53
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace all mock data with live data sources and fully integrate real-time workflows, social media, ClickUp, and analytics into the MarketingMachine platform.
# Details:
1. Analyze all JSON workflow files in the /workflows directory and map their data requirements to corresponding live sources. 2. Replace mock data endpoints and fixtures with real-time integrations for each workflow, leveraging n8n for orchestrating data flows and automating content creation, scheduling, and publishing across Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter/X, and TikTok using their respective APIs (e.g., Facebook Graph API, Instagram Graph API, LinkedIn API, Twitter API, TikTok for Developers). 3. Integrate ClickUp for live project and task data, ensuring bidirectional sync and real-time updates. 4. Optimize Supabase database schema and queries for high-volume, real-time data ingestion and retrieval. 5. Implement robust data validation, error handling, and fallback mechanisms for all live integrations. 6. Set up automated backup and disaster recovery strategies for all critical data flows. 7. Build a monitoring dashboard to track data health, workflow execution, and system performance under real data loads. 8. Populate the analytics dashboard and content calendar with actual metrics and planning data from live sources. 9. Document all data sources, integration points, and error handling strategies. 10. Prepare a live demo environment showcasing the fully operational platform with real data.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all workflows in /workflows operate exclusively on live data, with no mock data present. 2. Test social media integrations by posting to each connected platform and confirming successful publication and data retrieval. 3. Validate real-time n8n workflow execution and data propagation across all modules. 4. Confirm ClickUp integration by syncing tasks and projects and checking for real-time updates in both systems. 5. Stress-test Supabase with production-level data volumes and monitor for performance bottlenecks. 6. Simulate data source failures to ensure error handling and fallback mechanisms work as intended. 7. Review backup and disaster recovery procedures by performing test restores. 8. Inspect analytics dashboard and content calendar to ensure they display accurate, live metrics and planning data. 9. Conduct a live demo walkthrough to demonstrate end-to-end functionality with real data. 10. Review documentation for completeness and clarity.
