## 1. Set Up OAuth Authentication for Google Ads and Meta Ads APIs [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement OAuth authentication flows to securely connect and authenticate with Google Ads and Meta Ads APIs.
### Details:
Create OAuth endpoints in the Next.js application to handle the authentication process for both Google Ads and Meta Ads. This involves setting up routes for initiating the OAuth flow, handling callbacks, and securely storing access tokens in the Supabase database. Ensure that environment variables are configured to store client IDs, client secrets, and redirect URIs for both APIs.
