# Task ID: 30
# Title: Transform Main Dashboard to AI-Driven Enterprise BI Dashboard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 7, 9, 10, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Revamp the main dashboard into a high-tech AI-driven enterprise BI dashboard featuring real-time revenue trending, AI assistant integration, predictive analytics, glass morphism design, and a smart KPI grid.
# Details:
To transform the main dashboard into an AI-driven enterprise BI dashboard, start by integrating real-time revenue trending using data streams from existing data sources. Implement predictive analytics using machine learning models to forecast key business metrics. Integrate the AI assistant developed in Task 10 to provide contextual insights and support. Redesign the UI using glass morphism design principles, ensuring a modern and visually appealing interface. Develop a smart KPI grid that dynamically updates based on user interactions and data changes. Ensure the dashboard supports both Dutch and English languages, leveraging the internationalization setup from Task 7. Collaborate with the design team to ensure the new design aligns with the premium UI/UX design system from Task 9.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the dashboard displays real-time revenue trends accurately by comparing with source data. Test predictive analytics models for accuracy and performance under various scenarios. Ensure the AI assistant provides relevant insights and integrates seamlessly with the dashboard. Validate the glass morphism design across different devices and browsers for consistency. Test the smart KPI grid for responsiveness and accuracy in displaying data. Conduct user testing to ensure the dashboard meets usability and accessibility standards. Verify language switching functionality and ensure all text is correctly translated.
