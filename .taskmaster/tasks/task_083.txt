# Task ID: 83
# Title: Transform Platform with Futuristic UI/UX Design System ('Bedrijf uit de Toekomst')
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 43, 80, 81, 82, 77
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign and implement the entire FutureMarketingAI platform with a cutting-edge, futuristic UI/UX system that delivers immersive, accessible, and enterprise-grade experiences across all devices.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive design system that embodies a futuristic yet accessible aesthetic, leveraging next-generation glassmorphism, holographic UI elements, particle systems, and neural network-inspired data flows. Integrate AI-powered dynamic color schemes, advanced typography, and intelligent layout adaptation for optimal usability and information hierarchy. Implement contextual help overlays, micro-interactions, and progressive disclosure for intuitive workflow guidance. Use CSS-in-JS (styled-components), Framer Motion for high-performance animations, Three.js and WebGL for 3D and holographic elements, and canvas-based data visualizations. Ensure all components—MarketingMachine Control Center, BI Dashboards, AI Assistant, analytics, forms, navigation, cards, and buttons—are transformed with immersive effects, energetic states, and accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1). Optimize for touch, voice, and AR/VR readiness, with a mobile-first approach and deep space dark theme. Deliver full documentation, responsive design tokens, animation guidelines, accessibility checklists, and performance optimization strategies. Coordinate closely with existing admin dashboards, control centers, and analytics modules to ensure seamless integration and visual consistency.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct comprehensive visual and usability testing across desktop, tablet, and mobile, ensuring all futuristic elements render smoothly and maintain 60fps animations. 2. Validate accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1) using automated and manual audits. 3. Perform cross-browser and device compatibility checks, including touch and gesture interactions. 4. Test all transformed components for information hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and workflow guidance. 5. Run performance benchmarks on animation and 3D rendering. 6. Gather user feedback through interactive prototypes and iterate based on results. 7. Review documentation, design tokens, and style guides for completeness and clarity.
