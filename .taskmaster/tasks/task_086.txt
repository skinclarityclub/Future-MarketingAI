# Task ID: 86
# Title: Integrate Contextual AI Assistant with Multi-Mode Memory and Futuristic UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 10, 30, 36, 53, 54, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 77, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate a universal, context-aware AI assistant as the core USP of FutureMarketingAI, featuring three distinct operational modes (Website Assistant, MarketingMachine Assistant, Dashboard Assistant) with advanced memory, contextual switching, and a futuristic UI/UX.
# Details:
1. Architect a modular AI assistant engine supporting three modes: (a) Website Assistant (stateless, no session memory, optimized for conversion and education), (b) MarketingMachine Assistant (persistent user/org-scoped memory for tactical marketing workflows), and (c) Dashboard Assistant (persistent memory for BI/data analytics, complex queries, and forecasting).
2. Implement context switching logic to dynamically route queries and manage memory boundaries between modes. Use a robust memory persistence layer (e.g., PostgreSQL with LangChain's PostgresChatMessageHistory or similar) for persistent modes, ensuring secure, user-scoped storage and retrieval of conversation history and context[4][2][5].
3. Integrate real-time data sources for live insights and proactive suggestions, leveraging existing analytics, workflow, and content engines.
4. Develop a futuristic floating assistant UI with holographic avatar, contextual popups, voice-to-text/text-to-speech, and multi-language support (Dutch/English), ensuring seamless embedding across all platform modules.
5. Prepare for voice command support and advanced NLP for complex business queries, and implement a knowledge base management system for mode-specific information retrieval.
6. Build a performance analytics module to track AI interaction quality, conversion, and user satisfaction.
7. Provide training materials and onboarding flows for optimal usage by different user types.

# Test Strategy:
- Validate mode switching and context isolation by simulating user journeys across Website, MarketingMachine, and Dashboard contexts, ensuring correct memory behavior (stateless vs persistent).
- Test persistent memory by verifying conversation continuity, context recall, and data privacy for individual users/organizations in MarketingMachine and Dashboard modes.
- Conduct end-to-end tests for real-time data integration, proactive suggestions, and knowledge base retrieval in each mode.
- Perform comprehensive UI/UX testing: floating assistant, holographic avatar, contextual popups, voice/text features, and multi-language support.
- Benchmark AI response accuracy, speed, and conversion metrics; review analytics dashboards for AI usage and satisfaction.
- Review training materials for clarity and completeness with user onboarding sessions.
