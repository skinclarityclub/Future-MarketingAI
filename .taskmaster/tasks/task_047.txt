# Task ID: 47
# Title: Fix '[object Event]' Error in Dashboard Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 23, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Audit and fix the '[object Event]' error in dashboard components caused by unhandled promise rejections or improper event handling.
# Details:
1. **Audit Dashboard Components**: Review all React components within the dashboard to identify instances where the '[object Event]' error occurs. Focus on components that utilize event handlers and promise-based operations.

2. **Handle Promise Rejections**: Ensure all promises within the components are properly handled using `.catch()` or `try-catch` blocks to prevent unhandled rejections.

3. **Correct Event Handling**: Verify that event handlers are correctly implemented. Ensure that event objects are not mistakenly passed to functions expecting different data types, especially in `toLocaleString()` calls.

4. **Implement Error Boundaries**: Introduce React error boundaries in key components to catch and display errors gracefully, preventing the entire application from crashing.

5. **Type Checking**: Use TypeScript to enforce proper typing of event handlers and data processing functions to catch potential errors at compile time.

6. **Testing and Validation**: After implementing fixes, thoroughly test each component to ensure the error is resolved and no new issues are introduced.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for components to ensure promises are handled correctly and event handlers are properly typed.

2. **Integration Testing**: Conduct integration tests to verify that error boundaries are functioning as expected and that the application does not crash when errors occur.

3. **Manual Testing**: Manually trigger events and promise-based operations in the dashboard to confirm that the '[object Event]' error no longer appears.

4. **Code Review**: Conduct a peer review of the changes to ensure all potential error sources are addressed and best practices are followed.

Event Handler Typing Audit Completed Successfully:

✅ Fixed Type-Safety Issues in Chart Components:

1. Budget Performance Tracker (`budget-performance-tracker.tsx`):
   - Added safe `formatCurrency()` and `formatNumber()` functions
   - Fixed 4 unsafe chart formatter calls that used `value?.toLocaleString("nl-NL")`
   - Replaced with type-safe formatters that properly handle Event objects

2. Real-Time Revenue Trending (`real-time-revenue-trending.tsx`):
   - Added safe `formatCurrency()` and `formatNumber()` functions
   - Fixed 2 unsafe `toLocaleString()` calls in tooltip and display components
   - Replaced `entry.value.toLocaleString()` and `stream.value.toLocaleString()` with safe formatters

✅ Type Safety Improvements:
- All chart tooltip formatters now use type-safe functions that validate input types
- Functions handle `null`, `undefined`, and Event objects gracefully
- Consistent error prevention across all dashboard components
- Eliminated potential "[object Event]" errors from chart interactions

✅ Event Handler Review:
- Audited all click, change, and submit handlers across dashboard components
- Confirmed proper TypeScript typing in event handlers
- No unsafe event handler patterns found that could cause type errors

Technical Implementation:
- Safe formatting functions validate input types before processing
- Return fallback values for invalid inputs (objects, null, undefined)
- Maintain consistent Dutch locale formatting while preventing errors

Result: All dashboard components now have robust type-safe event handling that prevents the "[object Event]" error.
