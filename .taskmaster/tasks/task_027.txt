# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22, 23, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct thorough testing of the Perplexity research functionality to ensure accuracy, performance, and integration with existing systems.
# Details:
To test the Perplexity research functionality, first ensure that the feature is integrated correctly with the AI chatbot and data visualization components. Verify that the functionality can handle various data inputs and return accurate perplexity scores. Test the system's performance under different load conditions to ensure it meets the required response times. Additionally, check for any integration issues with the existing dashboard layout and internationalization features. Collaborate with the development team to address any bugs or performance bottlenecks identified during testing.

# Test Strategy:
