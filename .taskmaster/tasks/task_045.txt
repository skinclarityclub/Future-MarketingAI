# Task ID: 45
# Title: Fix Mode-Based Navigation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 44, 43, 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the mode-based navigation system to ensure dashboard content changes based on selected mode, fix navigation buttons, and resolve component import errors.
# Details:
1. Implement logic to dynamically change dashboard content based on the selected mode (executive, finance, marketing). Ensure each mode displays unique content: Executive Overview for executive mode, Financial Intelligence Dashboard for finance mode, and Marketing Optimization for marketing mode.
2. Update mode switcher buttons in the header to correctly navigate between different dashboards. Ensure URL-based mode detection is functioning properly to reflect the current mode in the URL.
3. Resolve import errors for marketing components to ensure they load correctly when the marketing mode is selected.
4. Collaborate with the team to ensure all components are correctly linked and displayed based on the mode selection. Utilize existing navigation structures from Task 44 and Task 43 to ensure consistency and reliability.
5. Conduct code reviews and refactor any redundant code to improve performance and maintainability.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that selecting each mode (executive, finance, marketing) updates the dashboard content to the correct mode-specific content.
2. Test the mode switcher buttons to ensure they navigate to the correct dashboards and update the URL accordingly.
3. Check that all components, especially marketing components, load without errors when their respective mode is selected.
4. Conduct user testing to ensure the navigation experience is intuitive and that the correct content is displayed for each mode.
5. Perform regression testing to ensure that changes do not affect other parts of the application.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Dynamic Dashboard Content Switching [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop logic to dynamically change dashboard content based on the selected mode (executive, finance, marketing). Ensure each mode displays unique content.
### Details:
Create a function that listens for mode changes and updates the dashboard content accordingly. Use a switch statement or similar logic to load the appropriate content component for each mode. Ensure that the Executive Overview, Financial Intelligence Dashboard, and Marketing Optimization components are correctly mapped to their respective modes.

SUBTASK 45.1 IMPLEMENTATION VOLTOOID ‚úÖ

üîß DYNAMIC DASHBOARD CONTENT SWITCHING GE√èMPLEMENTEERD:

1. ‚úÖ DASHBOARD MODE CONTEXT CREATED:
   - Nieuwe DashboardModeContext in /lib/contexts/dashboard-mode-context.tsx
   - Globale state management voor currentMode
   - URL-based mode detection (executive /, finance /financial, marketing /marketing)
   - Automatische route mapping en navigation

2. ‚úÖ LAYOUT INTEGRATION:
   - DashboardModeProvider toegevoegd aan hoofdlayout
   - UltraPremiumDashboardLayout gebruikt nu context i.p.v. lokale state
   - Sidebar en header krijgen mode vanuit globale context

3. ‚úÖ HOMEPAGE MODE SWITCHING:
   - Homepage renderDashboardContent() functie ge√Ømplementeerd
   - Switch statement voor mode-specific content:
     * Executive: ExecutiveOverview
     * Finance: FinancialIntelligenceDashboard + BudgetPerformanceTracker
     * Marketing: MarketingOptimization + ContentPerformanceOverview
   - Loading state tijdens mode detection

4. ‚úÖ IMPORT FIXES:
   - Alle marketing component imports gefixed (default export)
   - ContentPerformanceOverview en MarketingOptimization nu correct geladen

RESULTAAT: Dashboard content wordt nu dynamisch geladen op basis van geselecteerde mode. Elke mode toont compleet verschillende content!

NEXT: Subtask 45.2 - Mode Switcher Buttons en URL Navigation testen

## 2. Update Mode Switcher and URL-Based Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Modify mode switcher buttons in the header to correctly navigate between different dashboards and ensure URL-based mode detection reflects the current mode.
### Details:
Update the event handlers for the mode switcher buttons to change the URL based on the selected mode. Implement logic to parse the URL on page load to set the initial mode. Ensure that the URL updates correctly when the mode is changed.

## 3. Resolve Marketing Component Import Errors [done]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Fix import errors for marketing components to ensure they load correctly when the marketing mode is selected.
### Details:
Identify and resolve any import errors related to the marketing components. Check for missing or incorrect import paths and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and imported. Test the marketing mode to ensure all components load without errors.

## 4. Conduct Code Review and Refactor for Performance [done]
### Dependencies: 45.1, 45.2, 45.3
### Description: Review the codebase for redundant code and refactor to improve performance and maintainability. Ensure all components are correctly linked and displayed based on mode selection.
### Details:
Conduct a thorough code review focusing on the mode-based navigation system. Identify redundant or inefficient code and refactor it for better performance. Ensure that all components are correctly linked and displayed based on the mode selection. Collaborate with the team to ensure consistency with existing navigation structures.
