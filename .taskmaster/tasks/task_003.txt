# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Content ROI Tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system to track revenue attribution for each content piece.
# Details:
Integrate with Shopify and Kajabi APIs to collect content performance data. Implement algorithms to calculate content ROI and identify top-performing content. Provide optimization recommendations based on data analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Validate data collection from APIs. Test ROI calculations for accuracy and consistency. Ensure top-performing content is correctly identified.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Next.js Project with TypeScript and Supabase [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a Next.js project configured with TypeScript and integrate Supabase for backend services.
### Details:
Create a new Next.js application using TypeScript. Set up Supabase by creating a project on the Supabase platform, obtaining the API keys, and configuring the environment variables in the Next.js project. Ensure the project structure includes directories for components, pages, and services.

## 2. Integrate Shopify and Kajabi APIs [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop services to interact with Shopify and Kajabi APIs to collect content performance data.
### Details:
Create service modules in the Next.js project to handle API requests to Shopify and Kajabi. Implement functions to authenticate and fetch relevant data such as sales, customer interactions, and content engagement metrics. Store API credentials securely using environment variables.

## 3. Design and Implement Content ROI Calculation Algorithms [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop algorithms to calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each content piece based on collected data.
### Details:
Analyze the data retrieved from Shopify and Kajabi to identify key performance indicators. Implement algorithms that calculate ROI by correlating content engagement metrics with revenue data. Ensure the algorithms are modular and can be easily updated as needed.

## 4. Develop Dashboard Components to Display Content Performance [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create React components to visualize content performance metrics and ROI calculations.
### Details:
Design and implement reusable React components within the Next.js project to display data such as charts, tables, and key performance indicators. Utilize libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization. Ensure the components are responsive and accessible.

## 5. Implement Optimization Recommendation Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop a system to provide actionable recommendations for content optimization based on data analysis.
### Details:
Create a module that analyzes content performance data and identifies patterns or trends. Implement logic to generate recommendations for improving content effectiveness, such as suggesting topics, formats, or distribution channels. Integrate this module with the dashboard to display recommendations to users.
