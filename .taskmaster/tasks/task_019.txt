# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop Enhanced Context Awareness System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system to enhance the AI assistant's ability to understand and respond to user queries with greater context awareness.
# Details:
To develop the Enhanced Context Awareness System, integrate advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve the AI assistant's ability to understand the context of user queries. This involves analyzing the current state of the dashboard, user roles, and permissions to tailor responses accurately. Implement machine learning models that can learn from user interactions to continuously improve context recognition. Ensure the system can access and interpret data from various sources, including Shopify, Kajabi, and internal databases, to provide comprehensive and contextually relevant responses. Collaborate with the team working on Task 10 to ensure seamless integration with the existing AI assistant.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct unit tests on the NLP components to ensure they correctly interpret context from sample queries.
2. Perform integration tests with the AI assistant to verify that context-aware responses are generated accurately based on different dashboard states and user roles.
3. Use real-world scenarios to test the system's ability to adapt and improve context recognition over time.
4. Validate the system's performance by comparing response accuracy before and after the implementation of the enhanced context awareness features.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Select Advanced NLP Techniques [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and evaluate advanced natural language processing techniques to enhance the AI assistant's context awareness.
### Details:
Explore techniques such as contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT), attention mechanisms, and semantic role labeling to improve the AI's understanding of user queries. Assess their applicability and effectiveness in enhancing context recognition.

## 2. Analyze User Roles and Permissions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the current user roles and permissions to tailor AI responses accurately.
### Details:
Review the existing dashboard to understand user roles and permissions. Identify how these roles influence user interactions and how the AI assistant can leverage this information to provide contextually relevant responses.

## 3. Develop Machine Learning Models for Context Recognition [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create and train machine learning models to improve the AI assistant's ability to recognize and interpret context from user interactions.
### Details:
Utilize the selected NLP techniques to develop models that can learn from user interactions, enabling the AI assistant to understand context more effectively. Implement reinforcement learning to optimize conversational quality.

## 4. Integrate Data Sources for Comprehensive Contextual Responses [done]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Ensure the AI assistant can access and interpret data from various sources to provide comprehensive and contextually relevant responses.
### Details:
Implement integration with platforms such as Shopify, Kajabi, and internal databases. Utilize protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to facilitate seamless data access and interpretation.

## 5. Collaborate for Seamless Integration with Existing AI Assistant [done]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Work with the team responsible for Task 10 to ensure the new context awareness system integrates seamlessly with the existing AI assistant.
### Details:
Coordinate with the development team to align the enhanced context awareness system with the current AI assistant's architecture. Address any compatibility issues and ensure smooth deployment.
