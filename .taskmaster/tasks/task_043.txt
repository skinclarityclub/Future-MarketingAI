- **Sidebar:** Collapsible sidebar with main navigation items
- **Mobile Navigation:** Separate mobile nav with bottom bar pattern

### **2. CURRENT NAVIGATION ITEMS (from sidebar.tsx):**

**Main Navigation Items:**
1. âœ… **Overview** (`/`) - Executive summary and key metrics
2. âœ… **Revenue Analytics** (`/revenue`) - Revenue trends and forecasting  
3. âœ… **Performance Metrics** (`/performance`) - KPIs and business performance
4. âœ… **Customer Insights** (`/customers`) - Customer analytics and segmentation
5. âœ… **Customer Intelligence** (`/customer-intelligence`) - 360Â° customer view [NEW badge]

- âœ… **Help & Support** (`/help`) - Documentation and support

### **3. IDENTIFIED PAIN POINTS & ISSUES:**

**ðŸ”´ MAJOR STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS:**

1. **FINANCE vs MARKETING MODE CONFUSION:**
   - Navigation doesn't clearly distinguish between Finance and Marketing modes
   - Items like "Revenue Analytics" and "Performance Metrics" overlap conceptually
   - No clear visual mode switching mechanism

2. **EXCESSIVE DEMO/TEST PAGES:**
   - Multiple demo pages cluttering production navigation
   - Advanced-chatbot-**demo**, demo-charts, ai-integration-**demo**
   - Navigation includes test/development pages that shouldn't be in production

3. **INCONSISTENT INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE:**
   - "Customer Insights" vs "Customer Intelligence" - unclear distinction
   - "Analytics" is too broad alongside specific "Revenue Analytics"
   - Multiple similar reporting features without clear hierarchy

4. **MOBILE/DESKTOP NAVIGATION DISCONNECT:**
   - Separate mobile navigation component with different item structure
   - Bottom navigation on mobile doesn't align with sidebar structure
   - Inconsistent navigation experience across devices

**ðŸ”´ USER FLOW PROBLEMS:**

1. **Unclear Entry Points:**
   - Homepage redirects to `/nl` but unclear what the main dashboard actually is
   - No clear "Finance Dashboard" vs "Marketing Dashboard" distinction

2. **Navigation Depth Issues:**
   - Flat navigation structure doesn't scale with growing feature set
   - No sub-navigation or categorization for related features

3. **Context Switching:**
   - Users can't easily switch between Finance and Marketing workflows
   - No visual indication of current "mode" or context

**ðŸ“Š URGENCY ASSESSMENT:**
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Finance/Marketing mode distinction (affects core business workflow)
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Remove demo/test pages from production navigation
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Consolidate overlapping navigation items
- **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Improve mobile/desktop navigation consistency

**NEXT PHASE:** Design new Information Architecture with clear Finance/Marketing mode separation
