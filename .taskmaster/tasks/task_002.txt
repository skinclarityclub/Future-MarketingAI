# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Executive Dashboard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Executive Dashboard to provide high-level business performance overview.
# Details:
Use Next.js to create a responsive dashboard layout. Implement real-time KPI metrics display using Supabase for data fetching. Ensure the dashboard loads in under 3 seconds and updates data every 5 minutes. Include export functionality for key metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard loading time and data update frequency. Validate KPI metrics accuracy against sample data. Check export functionality for correctness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Next.js Project with TypeScript and Supabase [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a Next.js project configured with TypeScript and integrate Supabase for backend services.
### Details:
Create a new Next.js application with TypeScript support using the command `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`. Install necessary dependencies including Supabase client libraries. Configure environment variables for Supabase URL and API keys in a `.env.local` file. Initialize the Supabase client in a utility file for reuse across the application.

## 2. Design and Implement Responsive Dashboard Layout [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a responsive dashboard layout using Next.js components and Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Set up Tailwind CSS for styling by installing the necessary packages and configuring the `tailwind.config.js` file. Develop reusable React components for the dashboard layout, including a navigation bar, sidebar, and main content area. Ensure the layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.

## 3. Implement Real-Time KPI Metrics Display [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Develop components to fetch and display real-time KPI metrics from Supabase.
### Details:
Define the data schema for KPI metrics in Supabase, including tables and necessary relationships. Create API routes in Next.js to fetch KPI data from Supabase. Develop React components to display the metrics, ensuring they update every 5 minutes using a polling mechanism or real-time subscriptions.

## 4. Optimize Dashboard Performance [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Ensure the dashboard loads in under 3 seconds and maintains optimal performance.
### Details:
Implement code splitting and lazy loading for components to reduce initial load time. Optimize images and other assets for faster loading. Utilize Next.js's built-in performance optimization features, such as automatic static optimization and server-side rendering where appropriate.

Implemented comprehensive performance optimizations including: 1) Next.js config optimizations (code splitting, compression, image optimization, webpack bundles), 2) Lazy loading with Suspense for dashboard components, 3) In-memory caching system with TTL for API responses, 4) Performance monitoring hooks and debug component, 5) Bundle analyzer integration, 6) Performance scripts in package.json. Dashboard now loads efficiently with caching, monitoring, and optimized bundles. All targets met for sub-3-second load times.

## 5. Add Export Functionality for Key Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement functionality to export key metrics data in various formats.
### Details:
Develop backend API endpoints to generate and serve data exports in formats such as CSV and PDF. Create frontend components that allow users to trigger data exports and download the files. Ensure the export process handles large datasets efficiently and provides user feedback during the operation.
