# Task ID: 92
# Title: Redesign or Remove Social Media Widget
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 83
# Priority: high
# Description: Revamp or eliminate the social media widget in the bottom-right corner to align with the platform's premium and futuristic design language.
# Details:
Evaluate the current social media widget implementation and decide whether to remove it entirely or redesign it to fit the high-tech, futuristic aesthetic of the platform. If redesigning, consider using subtle animations, glassmorphism, or holographic elements to create a sophisticated look. Ensure the widget integrates seamlessly with the existing UI/UX design system ('Bedrijf uit de Toekomst'). If removing, ensure that no residual code or UI elements remain. Coordinate with the design team to ensure consistency with the overall platform design and user experience.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the social media widget is either completely removed or redesigned according to the new specifications. 2. Conduct visual inspections to ensure the widget (if redesigned) aligns with the futuristic design language and does not disrupt the overall UI/UX. 3. Test the functionality of the widget (if redesigned) to ensure it operates smoothly without performance issues. 4. Perform cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility across all major browsers. 5. Validate that the widget (if redesigned) is responsive and displays correctly on various screen sizes and devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Evaluate Current Widget and Decide on Action [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess the current social media widget to determine if it should be redesigned or removed based on alignment with the platform's design language.
