# Task ID: 82
# Title: Develop Integrated Admin Dashboard (Master Command Center)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 8, 30, 31, 36, 37, 53, 54, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 80, 81
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a secure, role-restricted admin dashboard providing real-time system health, business analytics, workflow performance, customer intelligence, operational controls, and security/compliance monitoring for the entire FutureMarketingAI platform.
# Details:
Design and implement a comprehensive admin dashboard accessible only to the platform owner via robust role-based access control. Integrate real-time data streaming for system health (uptime, performance, resource utilization, API/third-party status), revenue/business analytics (MRR, CAC, LTV, funnel, geo, pricing), workflow performance (n8n stats, content success, publishing, A/B, AI usage, satisfaction), customer intelligence (active users, adoption, support, health, anomalies, churn), operational controls (kill switches, feature flags, A/B config, maintenance, comms, bulk ops, export/backup), and security/compliance (login monitoring, audit logs, GDPR, incidents, API usage, suspicious activity). Use a modular, mobile-responsive UI with customizable widgets, export/reporting, and alert notification system (email, Telegram). Integrate with existing dashboard navigation and ensure seamless data aggregation from all relevant subsystems. Prioritize clarity, actionable insights, and intuitive controls, following dashboard UX best practices (clear KPIs, logical grouping, interactivity, and at-a-glance visibility).

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify access control restricts dashboard to the intended admin user only. 2. Test real-time data feeds for all system health, analytics, workflow, and security metrics using simulated and live data. 3. Validate accuracy and timeliness of business and customer analytics by cross-referencing with source systems. 4. Trigger operational controls (e.g., kill switch, feature flags) and confirm correct system response. 5. Simulate security incidents and confirm alerting, logging, and compliance tracking. 6. Test export/reporting and notification delivery (email, Telegram). 7. Conduct usability testing for widget customization, navigation, and mobile responsiveness. 8. Review dashboard for clarity, actionable insights, and adherence to best practices.
