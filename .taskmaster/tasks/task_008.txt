# Task ID: 8
# Title: Setup Real-time Monitoring and Alerts
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement system health and data quality monitoring features.
# Details:
Set up monitoring for data collection status, system performance, and data quality. Implement error detection and automated recovery mechanisms. Optimize workflow performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test monitoring system for accuracy and responsiveness. Validate error detection and recovery processes. Ensure workflow optimization is effective.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Supabase Project and Configure Database [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a Supabase project and configure the database schema for monitoring system health and data quality.
### Details:
Create a new Supabase project and set up tables to store system health metrics and data quality indicators. Ensure that real-time capabilities are enabled for these tables to allow for live monitoring.
<info added on 2025-06-16T20:18:30.927Z>
The database schema is fully configured with the following tables: system_health_metrics, data_quality_indicators, system_alerts, monitoring_dashboard_config, and system_performance_logs. All tables are included in the Supabase types definition, and real-time capabilities are enabled by default. The database foundation for monitoring is complete.

## 2. Integrate Supabase with Next.js Application [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Connect the Next.js TypeScript application to the Supabase backend to enable data interaction.
### Details:
Install the Supabase client library in the Next.js application and configure it using environment variables for the Supabase URL and Anon Key. Create a utility file to initialize and export the Supabase client for use throughout the application.
<info added on 2025-06-16T20:21:28.501Z>
Supabase integration is fully implemented with comprehensive setup:

1. Client-side integration using createClient() in client.ts
2. Server-side integration using createServerClient() in server.ts with cookie handling
3. Admin client setup using createAdminClient() for privileged operations
4. API route integration using createServerClientForApi()
5. Monitoring service implemented with a complete MonitoringService class featuring real-time subscriptions
6. Helper functions created: recordPerformanceMetric() and recordDataSourceQuality()

A test endpoint /api/test-monitoring has been created to verify the integration works correctly. The Supabase client library is configured with environment variables and supports all monitoring operations, including real-time updates.

## 3. Develop Real-time Monitoring Components [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create React components to display real-time system health and data quality metrics.
### Details:
Design and implement React components that subscribe to real-time updates from Supabase tables. Use Supabase's real-time capabilities to listen for changes and update the UI accordingly. Ensure that the components are structured within the Next.js file system for optimal performance.

## 4. Implement Error Detection and Automated Recovery Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Set up error detection and automated recovery features to maintain system stability.
### Details:
Develop functions to detect anomalies in system health and data quality metrics. Implement automated recovery procedures that can be triggered when specific thresholds are breached. Integrate these functions with the monitoring components to provide immediate feedback and corrective actions.

Successfully implemented comprehensive error detection and automated recovery system:

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
1. Created ErrorDetectionService class with:
   - Anomaly detection algorithms
   - Configurable threshold-based rules
   - Automated recovery actions (alert, restart, scale, custom)
   - Cooldown mechanisms to prevent spam
   - Recovery history tracking

2. Default rules implemented:
   - High Error Rate detection (5% warning, 10% critical)
   - Data Quality Drop detection (80% warning, 70% critical)
   - System Overload detection (80% warning, 90% critical)

3. Recovery mechanisms:
   - Alert notifications (console/webhook ready)
   - Service restart capabilities
   - Auto-scaling triggers
   - Custom data pipeline actions

4. API endpoint at /api/monitoring/error-detection:
   - POST for anomaly detection testing
   - Rule management (add/remove/enable/disable)
   - GET for rules and history retrieval

5. ErrorDetectionWidget component:
   - Real-time rule status monitoring
   - Test functionality for anomaly detection
   - Rule toggle capabilities
   - Recent anomalies display
   - Summary statistics

6. Integrated with monitoring dashboard

The system can detect anomalies based on configurable thresholds, automatically trigger recovery actions with cooldown protection, and provide comprehensive monitoring through both API and UI. Ready for production use with external integration points for actual alerting systems.
