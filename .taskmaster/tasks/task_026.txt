# Task ID: 26
# Title: Complete Dutch Translation for BI Dashboard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 23, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Translate all hardcoded English text to Dutch, extend i18n dictionaries, and ensure professional business terminology.
# Details:
This task involves translating all hardcoded English text within the BI Dashboard to Dutch. This includes UI components, navigation elements, error messages, form fields, and data visualization labels. Extend the existing i18n dictionaries to include all necessary Dutch translations, ensuring that the translations are accurate and use professional business terminology. Collaborate with a professional translator if necessary to ensure the quality of translations. Ensure that the translations are consistent across the application and align with the existing Dutch translations from Task 25. Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all UI components, pages, and texts have been translated to Dutch.
2. Check that the i18n dictionaries have been updated with the new translations and that they are correctly loaded in the application.
3. Conduct a review with a native Dutch speaker to ensure the translations are accurate and use appropriate business terminology.
4. Test the application in both Dutch and English to ensure that switching languages works seamlessly and that there are no missing translations.
5. Validate that all error messages, form validations, and data visualization labels are correctly translated and displayed.
