Adjust text colors and background effects, then use automated tools to verify compliance with WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios. 3. Remove duplicate elements and verify their absence visually and through code inspection. 4. Test typography changes across various devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and professional appearance. 5. Gather feedback from stakeholders to ensure the visual hierarchy aligns with brand standards.
