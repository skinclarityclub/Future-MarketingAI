# Task ID: 23
# Title: Integrate Individual Dashboard Pages with Main Layout Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all individual dashboard pages with the main layout components to ensure consistency with the rest of the application, supporting both Dutch and English versions via i18n.
# Details:
To integrate individual dashboard pages such as revenue and customer intelligence with the main layout components, first ensure that each page uses the DashboardLayout wrapper. This wrapper should include the header, sidebar, chatbot, and other navigation elements to maintain consistency across the application. Ensure that the styling aligns with the main application theme. Implement internationalization (i18n) to support both Dutch and English versions, leveraging existing i18n configurations. Review each page's content and structure to ensure it adheres to the application's design system and user experience guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that each dashboard page correctly uses the DashboardLayout wrapper by checking for the presence of the header, sidebar, and chatbot.
2. Test the navigation elements on each page to ensure they function correctly and provide a seamless user experience.
3. Switch the application language between Dutch and English and verify that all text elements on the dashboard pages are correctly translated.
4. Conduct visual inspections to ensure that the styling of each page is consistent with the main application theme.
5. Perform user acceptance testing to gather feedback on the integration and make necessary adjustments.
