# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Dark Theme for Dashboard Cards and Panels
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Update all dashboard cards, panels, and content blocks to use dark backgrounds consistent with the overall dark theme.
# Details:
The dark theme implementation for all dashboard components has been completed. A global CSS solution was implemented to override light backgrounds with dark theme colors. Specific component fixes were applied to ensure consistency and visual appeal. The global CSS file `src/app/globals.css` now includes overrides for common light background classes using dark semi-transparent colors. Specific components like the Budget Performance Tracker and Financial Intelligence Dashboard have been updated with consistent dark backgrounds and subtle borders for definition. Universal coverage is achieved with CSS overrides ensuring any remaining light backgrounds automatically receive dark treatment.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct visual inspections of all dashboard components to ensure they have dark backgrounds and maintain readability.
2. Use automated UI testing tools to verify that the color changes do not affect functionality or layout.
3. Test across multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent appearance.
4. Gather feedback from users to ensure the dark theme is visually appealing and functional.
5. Verify that the changes do not introduce any new visual bugs or regressions.
