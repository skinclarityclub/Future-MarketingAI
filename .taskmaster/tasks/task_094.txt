# Task ID: 94
# Title: Design and Implement Futuristic Fortune 500 Marketing Command Center UI
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 53, 68, 60, 36, 32, 34, 51, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a next-generation, enterprise-grade marketing command center interface that unifies all core features, live data integrations, and advanced UI elements to impress Fortune 500 clients.
# Details:
Architect and build a highly modular, 4K-ready dashboard interface that consolidates real-time monitoring (ClickUp, n8n, Blotato, A/B testing, content pipeline, platform health, ROI tracking) into a unified, customizable grid system. Implement advanced UI/UX features: holographic-style 3D data visualizations, glassmorphism with neon accents, neural network-inspired animations, real-time particle effects, and cyberpunk color schemes. Integrate floating panels, depth shadows, matrix-style data streams, and an AI avatar assistant. Ensure multi-screen support, mission control layout, real-time alerts, and prep for voice/gesture controls. Embed enterprise features: multi-user collaboration, audit logging, compliance and security dashboards, API rate limiting, cost tracking, and executive summary reporting. Prioritize performance, accessibility, and extensibility for future enhancements.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate real-time data feeds from all integrated systems (ClickUp, n8n, Blotato, A/B testing, content pipeline, ROI tracking) for accuracy and latency. 2. Conduct UI/UX reviews to ensure all futuristic elements (3D visualizations, glassmorphism, neon effects, AI avatar, matrix streams) render correctly across 4K/multi-screen setups. 3. Test widget grid customization, floating panels, and mission control layout for usability and responsiveness. 4. Simulate multi-user collaboration, audit logging, and compliance monitoring scenarios. 5. Verify real-time alerts, notifications, and emergency controls function as intended. 6. Perform accessibility and performance audits to meet enterprise standards. 7. Review executive summary reports and cost tracking for completeness and accuracy.
