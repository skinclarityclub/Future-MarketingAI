# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Internationalized Routing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Next.js to support multiple languages by setting up internationalized routing.
### Details:
Update the `next.config.js` file to include the `i18n` configuration with the desired locales and default locale. This enables Next.js to handle routing for different languages.

## 2. Implement Language Switcher Component [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a language switcher component to allow users to change the application's language.
### Details:
Develop a React component that lists available languages and updates the application's locale when a user selects a different language. Ensure the selected language is stored in `localStorage` for persistence.

## 3. Manage Translation Files [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Organize and manage translation files for different languages.
### Details:
Create a `locales` directory containing JSON files for each supported language. Each file should include key-value pairs for all translatable text in the application.

## 4. Integrate Translations into Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Load and apply translations in React components based on the current locale.
### Details:
Utilize a library like `next-intl` to load the appropriate translation file based on the current locale and provide translated strings to components.

## 5. Implement Locale-Specific Number Formatting [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Ensure that numbers are formatted according to the conventions of the current locale.
### Details:
Use JavaScript's `Intl.NumberFormat` API to format numbers in a locale-aware manner throughout the application.
