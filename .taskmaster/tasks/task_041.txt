# Task ID: 41
# Title: Develop Advanced Observability Stack
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive observability stack using Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring, ELK stack for logging, distributed tracing, real-time alerting, and integrations with PagerDuty/Slack to ensure 99.99% SLA monitoring.
# Details:
To develop the Advanced Observability Stack, start by setting up Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from all critical services and set up Grafana dashboards to display these metrics in real-time. Implement the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging. Configure Logstash to collect logs from various services and send them to Elasticsearch, where they can be queried and visualized in Kibana. Integrate distributed tracing using tools like Jaeger or OpenTelemetry to trace requests across microservices. Set up real-time alerting using Prometheus Alertmanager, and configure alerts to be sent to PagerDuty and Slack for immediate incident response. Ensure the entire stack is highly available and can support a 99.99% SLA by implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms. Document the setup process and provide training for the operations team to manage and extend the observability stack.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Prometheus is correctly scraping metrics from all services and Grafana dashboards are displaying these metrics accurately.
2. Test the ELK stack by generating logs from various services and ensuring they appear in Kibana with correct indexing and searchability.
3. Validate distributed tracing by initiating requests across microservices and confirming traces are captured and visualized correctly.
4. Simulate incidents to test real-time alerting, ensuring alerts are sent to PagerDuty and Slack as configured.
5. Conduct failover tests to ensure the observability stack maintains 99.99% availability under failure conditions.
