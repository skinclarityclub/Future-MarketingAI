# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Advanced AI Navigation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an advanced AI navigation system to enhance user interaction and data accessibility within the dashboard.
# Details:
The Advanced AI Navigation System will leverage machine learning algorithms to provide intuitive navigation and data retrieval within the dashboard. This system will use AI to predict user needs and suggest relevant data and insights proactively. Implement a recommendation engine that analyzes user behavior and dashboard usage patterns to optimize the navigation experience. Integrate with existing AI components from Task 10 to ensure seamless interaction between the navigation system and the AI assistant. Use natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to navigate the dashboard using voice commands or text queries. Ensure the system is scalable and can handle large volumes of data efficiently. Consider user privacy and data security in the design, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct unit tests to verify the functionality of the navigation algorithms and recommendation engine.
2. Perform integration tests to ensure seamless interaction with the AI assistant developed in Task 10.
3. Test the NLP capabilities by simulating various user queries and voice commands to ensure accurate navigation and data retrieval.
4. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a group of users to gather feedback on the navigation experience and make necessary adjustments.
5. Verify data security and privacy compliance by conducting security audits and ensuring encryption of sensitive data.
