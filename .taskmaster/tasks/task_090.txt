# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 83, 89
# Priority: highest
# Description: Revamp the CTA strategy by replacing 'Start Free Trial' buttons with 'Schedule Conversation' or 'Book Consultation' to target premium businesses.
# Details:
1. Identify all instances of 'Start Free Trial' buttons across the platform, including the hero section and any other prominent locations. 2. Replace these buttons with 'Schedule Conversation' or 'Book Consultation' to align with the new premium consultation approach. 3. Ensure the new CTAs are visually appealing and consistent with the platform's design language. 4. Remove duplicate 'Fortune 500 demo' buttons and rename them to 'DEMO' for clarity. 5. Update the underlying logic to redirect users to a conversation booking page instead of a trial signup page. 6. Collaborate with the design team to ensure the new CTAs fit seamlessly into the existing UI/UX design system. 7. Coordinate with the backend team to ensure the booking system is fully integrated and functional.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all 'Start Free Trial' buttons have been replaced with 'Schedule Conversation' or 'Book Consultation' across the platform. 2. Test the visual consistency of the new CTAs with the platform's design system. 3. Ensure that clicking the new CTAs redirects users to the correct booking page. 4. Validate that the booking page is fully functional and allows users to schedule consultations. 5. Check for the removal of duplicate 'Fortune 500 demo' buttons and confirm they are renamed to 'DEMO'. 6. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the new CTA strategy and make adjustments as necessary.
