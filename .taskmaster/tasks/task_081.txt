# Task ID: 81
# Title: Implement Tiered Access Control and Upgrade Architecture for FutureMarketingAI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36, 53, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 71, 72, 73, 80
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust, intelligent tiered access system enabling seamless user progression from preview mode to paid MarketingMachine and BI Dashboard tiers, with integrated upgrade, billing, and analytics flows.
# Details:
Design and implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system that enforces feature restrictions for Preview, MarketingMachine, and MarketingMachine + BI Dashboard tiers. Integrate feature flagging to dynamically enable or disable features per user tier, including read-only dashboards, limited AI interactions, demo content creation, analytics, and watermarked exports in Preview. Build a seamless upgrade flow that preserves user data and context, supports in-app purchases, and integrates with the subscription management and billing system. Implement progressive disclosure UI patterns, smart upgrade prompts based on usage analytics, and feature comparison tooltips. Develop usage tracking and conversion analytics to monitor user engagement and optimize upgrade prompts. Ensure the architecture supports future extensibility for additional tiers or features. Coordinate with the unified Super Control Center for consistent user experience and leverage the existing MarketingMachine platform, analytics, and publishing infrastructure.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that users in each tier only have access to the appropriate features and that feature flags are enforced correctly. 2. Test the upgrade flow from Preview to MarketingMachine and to MarketingMachine + BI Dashboard, ensuring no data loss and seamless transition. 3. Validate billing and subscription management integration by simulating upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations. 4. Confirm that smart upgrade prompts and feature comparison tooltips display at strategic moments based on usage patterns. 5. Check that usage tracking and conversion analytics accurately reflect user actions and tier transitions. 6. Conduct end-to-end user journey tests covering onboarding, preview, upgrade, and retention scenarios. 7. Ensure all UI elements follow progressive disclosure and premium design guidelines.
