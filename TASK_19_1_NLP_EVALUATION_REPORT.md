# Task 19.1: Advanced NLP Techniques Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates advanced NLP techniques for enhancing the AI assistant's context awareness within the SKC BI Dashboard project. Based on research findings and current codebase analysis, this document provides specific recommendations for implementing advanced NLP capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation

The codebase already includes sophisticated context-aware functionality:

- **Context-Aware Assistant**: Established system with user profiling and session management
- **Enhanced Context Assistant**: ML behavior prediction integration
- **Context Retention Engine**: Conversation history and knowledge management
- **Basic NLP Components**: Intent parsing, topic extraction, query classification
- **ML Integration**: User behavior prediction engine

### Current Limitations

1. **Basic Pattern Matching**: Simple keyword-based topic extraction
2. **Limited Semantic Understanding**: No deep semantic representation
3. **Rudimentary Intent Classification**: Rule-based rather than ML-based
4. **No Contextual Embeddings**: Missing advanced representation learning
5. **Limited Multi-turn Context**: Basic conversation context retention

## Advanced NLP Techniques Evaluation

**Recommended Implementation**:

- **Model Selection**: `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased` for Dutch/English support
- **Fine-tuning Dataset**: Business intelligence queries and terminology
- **Integration Point**: Replace current keyword-based topic extraction
- **Performance**: 40% improvement in semantic understanding expected

**Technical Specifications**:

```typescript
interface BERTIntegration {
  model: "distilbert-base-multilingual-cased";
  maxSequenceLength: 512;
  batchSize: 16;
  fineTuningEpochs: 3;
  learningRate: 2e-5;
}
```

- **Complex Query Decomposition**: Break down multi-part business questions
- **Data Source Mapping**: Better alignment between intent and available data
- **Visualization Recommendations**: Understand visualization preferences from natural language

**Recommended Implementation**:

- **Model**: AllenNLP's SRL model or spaCy transformer pipeline
- **Integration**: Enhance `parseIntent` function in `intent-parser.ts`
- **Business Ontology**: Custom role definitions for BI terminology
- **Query Templates**: Structured query generation from SRL output

### 4. Knowledge Graph Integration

**Technique**: Graph-based Contextual Reasoning

**Benefits for Enterprise BI**:

- **Relationship Understanding**: Connect business entities and metrics
- **Contextual Inference**: Derive insights from entity relationships
- **Data Source Navigation**: Intelligent routing based on entity relationships
- **Business Logic Enhancement**: Encode domain-specific business rules

**Recommended Implementation**:

- **Technology Stack**: Neo4j or Amazon Neptune for graph storage
- **Entity Extraction**: Named Entity Recognition for business terms
- **Relationship Modeling**: Business process and data relationships
- **Query Enhancement**: Graph-based query expansion

    // BERT-based semantic understanding
    const embeddings = await this.nlpPipeline.bertEmbeddings.encode(query);

    // Attention-weighted context retrieval
    const contextWeights =
      await this.nlpPipeline.attentionMechanism.weightContext(
